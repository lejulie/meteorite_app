## Let's Talk About Meteorites

Check out the hosted version of this [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app at [https://lejulie.shinyapps.io/meteorite_app/](https://lejulie.shinyapps.io/meteorite_app/).

This app uses [this data](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh) on meteorites aggregated by [The Meteoritical Society](http://meteoriticalsociety.org/) to visualize the following attributes for over 30,000 meteorites here on Earth:

* Mass
* Date recorded
* Geography where found
* Categorization
* Fell vs. found (whether or not someone saw the meteorite fall from the sky)
