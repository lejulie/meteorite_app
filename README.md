## What are Meteorites?

According to [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/dictionary/Meteorite.html) , a meteorite is “a rock that has fallen to Earth from outer space.” When a piece of debris from an object (such as a comet or asteroid ) enters the atmosphere of a planet or moon (such as Earth), it becomes a meteor as it descends towards the surface. If the meteor survives passage all the way to the planet or moon’s surface, it is then considered a meteorite.

Meteors vary greatly in size, shape, and composition. This app lets you explore some of these attributes for over 30,000 meteorites here on Earth.

## Meteorite Characteristics

### Meteorite Sites

See where meterorites were found across the globe. Countries were derived using this reverse geocoder by [Ajay Thampi](https://github.com/thampiman).

### Fell vs. Found

Meterorites can be classified on whether or not a person saw their descent to Earth. A meteorite that someone witnessed falling to Earth and then successfully tracked down is classified as _fall_ or _fell_. One that was determined to be a meteorite by examination of its properties is classified as _found_. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite_fall) for more.

### Meteorite Categorization

Meteorites are classified by their physical, chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical properties, with the goal of grouping them ultimately by their origin (rocks from the same source should be made of similar stuff). There are several taxonomies for classifying meterorites. According to the [Meteoritical Society website](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/notes.php?note=6), the data here adheres to the following:

> If the meteorite was published in both the Catalogue of Meteorites and MetBase (see columns NHMCat and MetBase), both classifications will appear if they do not agree. If the meteorite was just published in one of these sources, the classification from that source will be listed. If the meteorite was published in neither, the classification comes from the Meteoritical Bulletin (approved names) or from unreviewed reports (provisional names).

You can read more about the classification of meteorites on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite_classification).

### Meteorite Mass

Meteorite masses in this dataset are in grams. A note on masses from the [Meteoritical Society website](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/notes.php?note=16):

> Masses are taken from the Catalogue of Meteorites, MetBase, and/or the Meteoritical Bulletin. In most cases, they represent the total known weight of the meteorite. The masses shown here should not be considered as authoritative, and may be rounded off.
