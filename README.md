# Meteorite Explorer

This [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) web app let's you explore characteristics of over 30,000 terrestrial meteorites.

## What are Meteorites?

When a piece of debris from an object (such as a comet or asteroid ) enters the atmosphere of a planet or moon (such as Earth), it becomes a meteor as it descends towards the surface. If the meteor survives passage all the way to the planet or moon’s surface, it is then considered a meteorite.

## Meteorite Characteristics

### Meteorite Sites

See where meterorites were found across the globe. Countries were derived using this reverse geocoder by [Ajay Thampi](https://github.com/thampiman).

### Fell vs. Found

Meterorites can be classified on whether or not a person saw their descent to Earth. A meteorite that someone witnessed falling to Earth and then successfully tracked down is classified as _fall_ or _fell_. One that was determined to be a meteorite by examination of its properties is classified as _found_. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite_fall) for more.

### Meteorite Categorization

Meteorites are classified by their physical, chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical properties, with the goal of grouping them ultimately by their origin (rocks from the same source should be made of similar stuff). See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite_classification) for more.

### Meteorite Mass

Masses in this dataset represent the total known weights of the meterorites.  The [Meteoritical Society website](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/notes.php?note=16) notes that they are note authoritative and may be rounded off.
